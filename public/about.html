<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Petra Duranova. I used to live in UK for 11 years. Working in hospitality most of the time. </p>

<p>In December 2023 we have decided to move into Portugal with my family. </p>

<p> And now, as it is difficult to be working mom, I have decided to change my career and started to learn about coding. </p>
